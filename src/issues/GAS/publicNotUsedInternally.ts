  title: 'Public functions not used internally can be marked as external to save gas',
  description:"Public functions that aren't used internally in Solidity contracts should be made external to optimize gas usage and improve contract efficiency. External functions can only be called from outside the contract, and their arguments are directly read from the calldata, which is more gas-efficient than loading them into memory, as is the case for public functions. By using external visibility, developers can reduce gas consumption for external calls and ensure that the contract operates more cost-effectively for users. Moreover, setting the appropriate visibility level for functions also enhances code readability and maintainability, promoting a more secure and well-structured contract design.",
